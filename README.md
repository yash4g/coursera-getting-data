*run_analysis.R: downloads all the required files to complete this assignment and creates a big file mean_and_std.csv and a small file tidy_dataset.csv (both are stored in /results)

*CodeBook.md: it is a brief explanation of what run_analysis.R does

R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).** Note that it requires the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which can be downloaded from CRAN.

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy.csv](tidy.csv).**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
